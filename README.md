# Notes on this and that

This project consists of my notes on this and that, such as the books
that I read, the films that I watch, and the topics in mathematics and
programming that interest me.  I also hope to write about the
Himalaya: the Garhwal Himalaya, some of which I have seen, and near
whose foothills I live.  The project is a work in progress.
